                    were made on 26 March 2015 and implement the requirements of the EU Accounting
                    Directive. With two exceptions, they apply to financial years beginning on or
                    after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted for financial years
                    beginning on or after 1 January 2015. The exceptions are as follows:</p>
                <ol class="bullet" xmlout="list" xml-iid="w2ab2c17b5b3c13" type="bullet">

                        The first exception has nothing to do with the EU Accounting Directive.
                            The Government decided to remove the concession whereby companies can
                            list only their <span class="q" xmlout="q" xml-iid="w2ab2c17b5b3c13b1b1b1">principal</span> subsidiaries and associates in their

                            has been driven by demands for greater transparency and concern that, in
                            practice, the complete listings were not always being filed with the
                            annual return. The requirement to include the complete listing of
                            subsidiaries, associates and certain other investments in the annual
                            accounts came into effect for accounts approved on or after 1 July 2015

                        The second exception is that early implementation is not permitted for
                            audit exemption purposes. The law is drafted so that the thresholds are
                            the same for both accounting and audit, but the government consulted
                            separately about whether the link should be maintained. It has
                            subsequently been confirmed that the thresholds will remain aligned but
                            for audit exemption purposes the increased limits only take effect for
                            years beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and cannot be adopted early.

                original Companies Bill but was added as the Bill was making its way through
                Parliament. The ministerial statement on its introduction was to the effect that the
                clear primacy of the true and fair concept had become blurred as a result of a
                combination of UK and EU law provisions. The opportunity was being taken to express
                the principle more clearly in the legislation.</p>

                relevance of the true and fair requirement for the preparation and audit of
                financial statements following the introduction of IFRSs and the enactment of the
                2006 Act. The opinion, which is available on the FRC website (<span class="web-ref" xmlout="web-ref" xml-iid="w2ab2c17b9b7b1" http="www.frc.org.uk"><i>www.frc.org.uk</i></span>), confirms the continuing
                relevance of earlier legal opinions on the interpretation of the true and fair
                requirement. One of the significant conclusions in the May 2008 Opinion is that <span class="q" xmlout="q" xml-iid="w2ab2c17b9b7b3" quote-marks="double">the requirement set out in applicable international
                    accounting standards to present fairly is not a different requirement to that of

                requirement to give a true and fair view except in extremely rare circumstances.
                However, the Opinion notes that the preparation of financial statements is not a
                mechanical process where compliance with accounting standards will automatically
                ensure that those statements show a true and fair view, or a fair presentation. For
                example, additional disclosures might be required to achieve a true and fair
                view.</p>

                EU audit legislation, legal advice obtained and published by the FRC in October
                2013, and feedback from stakeholders seeking clarity as to the primary requirement

                        a wider interpretation would not be appropriate. However, the publication of

                            assessment of whether group financial statements are required depends on
                            the situation at the end of the reporting period. As the administrator,
                            administrative receiver or liquidator is appointed after the reporting
                            period, there are no severe long-term restrictions at the end of the
                            reporting period and therefore the subsidiary should be included in the

                            it is located in a foreign jurisdiction, do not normally amount to a
                            severe restriction of rights. The fact that a parent may not be able to
                            remit dividends from the subsidiary or use the funds for other parts of
                            the group outside the country of operation does not by itself indicate
                            that the parent no longer has control over the operating and financial
                            policies of that subsidiary. Indeed, subsidiaries are often set up in
                            the face of such restrictions and are, presumably, expected to be
                            beneficial to the parent.</p>

                subsidiaries to prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRSs. It
                noted that the great majority of quoted <span class="q" xmlout="q" xml-iid="w2ab2c19c11b7b1">solo companies</span> are investment trusts,

                consolidated financial statements must prepare financial statements in accordance
                with the national law of the EEA State in which the issuer is incorporated.
                Companies incorporated in the UK therefore have a choice between UK GAAP and IFRSs
                which are both permitted by law. Some solo companies have decided to adopt IFRSs in
                any event to be consistent with competitors or because they are finance subsidiaries

                predecessor, the FRRP) has been successful in resolving all cases brought to its
                attention without having to apply for a court order.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c11">The Conduct Committee does not offer advice on the application of accounting
                standards or the requirements of the Act. There is no provision for
                    <span class="q" xmlout="q" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c11b1">pre-clearance</span> of accounting treatments with the Conduct Committee as
                happens in some other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c13">When it was established, the FRRP did not actively monitor the financial statements
                of those companies within its remit. It responded to complaints from members of the
                public, referrals from the FSA (now FCA) of companies whose auditors had qualified
                their reports and unfavourable press comments on companies’ financial
                statements. However, it assumed a pro-active role in response to the 2003 report of
                the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting. This group was set up by the
                Government to consider how the UK should respond to some well publicised corporate
                failures around that time.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c15">The Conduct Committee now considers any matter drawn to its attention from a review
                of reports selected by the Conduct Committee, or by complaints or press comments,
                including matters drawn to its attention by the FCA and by HMRC. It initially
                considers whether there is, prima facie, a case to answer. When there is such a
                case, the Chairman appoints a Review Group to conduct the enquiry. A group is
                normally made up of five members including the Chairman and one of the Deputy
                Chairmen. Other members are chosen to provide a balance of experience relevant to
                the enquiry and to avoid any conflicts of interests. The other members of the FRRP
                are not involved and the group’s exchanges with the company are
                confidential.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c17">The Review Group puts its concerns to the directors and may discuss them in
                correspondence and at meetings. The Conduct Committee encourages directors to
                consult their auditors, to involve their audit committee and to take any other
                advice they feel necessary. The process is informal but is intended to combine
                efficiency with fairness. As defective financial statements could mislead the
                public, the procedures are intended to allow for speedy rectification. The Review
                Group aims to reach agreement with the directors of the company by persuasion. If
                the Review Group is satisfied by the company’s explanations, the case is
                closed and the fact that an enquiry was made remains confidential. When the
                directors agree to take some remedial action, the Conduct Committee may issue a
                Press Notice. It may also do so in other circumstances following changes to its
                operating procedures in 2012. The Conduct Committee does not comment on or discuss
                its conclusions.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c19">The Conduct Committee selects reports and accounts for review in a number of ways.
                First, entities may be selected from specific sectors of the economy – for
                example those regarded as under particular stress. Second, reviews are prompted by
                specific topical accounting issues that may give rise to issues of increased
                subjectivity, judgement and risk of misstatement in corporate reporting. Last,
                complaints from the public, the press and the City may result in the selection of
                reports for review. In all cases, the selection is based on the Conduct
                Committee’s assessment of the risk of non-compliance and the risk of
                significant consequences if there is non-compliance.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c21">When UK companies report under IFRSs, enforcement is still a matter of UK company
                law. The Conduct Committee continues to play the role described above. However, in
                the IAS Regulation, the European Commission requested (what is now) the European
                Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to develop a harmonised approach to the
                enforcement of financial information in the EU. Pursuant to this mandate, the
                sub-committee on enforcement developed standards and application guidance with which
                all qualifying national enforcers are expected to comply and which provides for the
                co-ordination of enforcement activities. The Conduct Committee may, from time to
                time, propose issues arising from individual cases for discussion at extended
                sessions of the sub-committee. The Conduct Committee only identifies the company
                concerned if it has concluded the case and issued a press notice or the case has
                otherwise become public. The Conduct Committee is obliged to report certain cases of
                substance for inclusion in the database established by ESMA to assist in the
                harmonisation of EU accounting requirements.</p>
            <p class="p" xmlout="p" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c23">In recent years, the Conduct Committee has developed a practice of using so-called
                    <span class="q" xmlout="q" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c23b1">Committee references</span> in the majority of situations in which remedial
                action has been taken following its intervention, rather than issuing press notices.
                These involve the Committee requesting that in the report and accounts in which the
                company makes the change, reference is made to the Committee’s intervention.
                Such a reference allows the committee to ensure that investors and preparers are
                aware of the issue without necessarily drawing attention of the market at large to
                the situation, where it is not considered that this is necessary. Changes made to
                the Conduct Committee’s operating procedures in October 2014 formalised the
                position of <span class="q" xmlout="q" xml-iid="w2ab2c23b7c23b3">Committee references</span> and made certain other amendments.</p>

                    exemption. Directors of parent undertakings should weigh the benefits of using
                    the exemption with the costs of giving that guarantee, in particular the risk
                    that the guarantee may be called upon. The guidance notes that directors may
                    wish to take their own legal advice based on the specific facts and
                    circumstances. Some subsidiaries will require audits for contractual or

                        APMs are neither prohibited nor required by the ESMA Guidelines. The
                            choice of which APMs to provide, if any, is a matter of judgement of
                            those responsible for providing the information, such as the directors
                            in respect of the Annual Report. This judgement should be applied to
                            ensure the APMs provided are relevant and understandable for users
                            within the context of wider reporting responsibilities such as the

                            and understood. Within the Annual Report linkages might exist between

                        one of the most common is to present a table with rows showing each element

                        Another common presentation is to use a symbol to represent each strategy
                        element and simply present the relevant symbols next to each KPI. A similar
                        approach is also commonly used to indicate which KPIs are used in

                    significant flexibility that may impair the comparability and understandability
                    of financial statements. The request for clarification provided several examples

                    presentation of financial statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum

                    presentation, it also includes various principles for the presentation and
                    content of financial statements as well as more detailed requirements. These
                    principles and more detailed requirements are intended to limit the flexibility

                    presentation of information in the financial statements that is not determined
                    in accordance with IFRS. They were particularly concerned when such information
                    is presented on the face of the primary statements. The Interpretations
                    Committee noted that it would be beneficial if the IASB’s Disclosure
