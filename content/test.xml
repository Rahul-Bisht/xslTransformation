            <p>This chapter addresses subjects which are common to entities reporting both under
                IFRSs and under UK GAAP. Further information is given in <xref commentary="dgaap"

                <i>Application of Financial Reporting Requirements</i>. This new UK standard sets

                statements in accordance with legislation, regulations or accounting standards
                applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. [<standard-ref type="frs"

                give a true and fair view.</p>

                        Entities</i> (FRSSE). The FRSSE therefore formed part of the package of
                    standards becoming effective in 2015 although in practice it had a limited life.
                    As explained below, it was superseded by amendments to <standard-ref type="frs"
                        num="10214">FRS 102</standard-ref> for financial years beginning on or after

                    <p>Although <standard-ref type="frs" num="100">FRS 100</standard-ref> is a UK
                        accounting standard, the choice of accounting frameworks which it offers,
                        which is consistent with the requirements of the Act, includes the
                        preparation of financial statements under IFRSs.</p>

                    were made on 26 March 2015 and implement the requirements of the EU Accounting
                    Directive. With two exceptions, they apply to financial years beginning on or
                    after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted for financial years
                    beginning on or after 1 January 2015. The exceptions are as follows:</p>
                <list type="bullet">
                    <item>
                        <p>The first exception has nothing to do with the EU Accounting Directive.
                            The Government decided to remove the concession whereby companies can
                            list only their <q>principal</q> subsidiaries and associates in their
                            annual report and file a complete list with the annual return. This move
                            has been driven by demands for greater transparency and concern that, in
                            practice, the complete listings were not always being filed with the
                            annual return. The requirement to include the complete listing of
                            subsidiaries, associates and certain other investments in the annual
                            accounts came into effect for accounts approved on or after 1 July 2015
                            (see <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A14.6.2" anchor="6.2.1"><b>6.2.1</b>

                    <item>
                        <p>The second exception is that early implementation is not permitted for
                            audit exemption purposes. The law is drafted so that the thresholds are
                            the same for both accounting and audit, but the government consulted
                            separately about whether the link should be maintained. It has
                            subsequently been confirmed that the thresholds will remain aligned but
                            for audit exemption purposes the increased limits only take effect for
                            years beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and cannot be adopted early.
                            Further details about the audit exemption for small companies are given
                            in <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A6.5"><b>section 5</b> of <b>chapter

                </list>
                <p>The amendments primarily affect companies reporting under UK GAAP including
                        <standard-ref type="frs" num="10114">FRS 101</standard-ref>. However, some
                    changes, including those about disclosure of <q>related undertakings</q> (see
                        <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A14.6"><b>section 6</b> in <b>chapter
                        A14</b></xref>) affect financial statements prepared under IFRSs.</p>
                <p>Equivalent amendments were made for LLPs by <i><act-si-ref si-number="2016/575"
                            >The Limited Liability Partnerships, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts
                            and Audit) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/575)</act-si-ref></i>. The
                    effective dates are the same as for companies except that the requirement to
                    provide a complete list of subsidiaries, associates and certain other
                    investments came into effect for accounts approved on or after 1 July 2016.</p>
                <p>In July 2015, the FRC published changes to the UK financial reporting framework
                    resulting from these Regulations, including:</p>

                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>amendments to <standard-ref type="frs" num="100">FRSs 100</standard-ref>,
                                <standard-ref type="frs" num="10114">101</standard-ref> and
                                <standard-ref type="frs" num="10214">102</standard-ref> to introduce
                            a new regime for small companies to replace the FRSSE and to make other
                            necessary amendments as required by the changes in UK company law.</p>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>To the extent that these changes are due to adoption of the changes in the law
                    they have the same effective date as described above and must be adopted at the
                    same time. For example, early adoption of the amendments to <standard-ref
                        type="frs" num="10214">FRS 102</standard-ref> was possible only if the
                    Regulations were also adopted early and vice versa. However, some changes to
                        <standard-ref type="frs" num="10114">FRS 101</standard-ref> which arose from
                    the annual review of that standard rather than from changes in the law had an
                    earlier effective date (see <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A13.1"><b>chapter
                            A13</b></xref>). There was no restriction on early adoption of
                        <standard-ref type="frs" num="105">FRS 105</standard-ref> by a company that
                    was entitled to prepare financial statements under the micro-entities regime
                    (see <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A6.8"><b>section 8</b> in <b>chapter
                        A6</b></xref>).</p>
                <p>In May 2016, the FRC published limited amendments to <standard-ref type="frs"
                        num="105">FRS 105</standard-ref>. These amendments extended the scope of
                        <standard-ref type="frs" num="105">FRS 105</standard-ref> to include
                    eligible LLPs and qualifying partnerships following the change in legislation
                    mentioned above.</p>
                <p>The effect of the changes in the law and the related changes to accounting
                    standards are considered in the appropriate chapters of this manual. The
                    requirements of <standard-ref type="frs" num="105">FRS 105</standard-ref> are
                    outside the scope of this manual but a summary is provided in <xref

                        >s401</act-si-ref> requires an analysis of a particular set of consolidated

                    equivalent to consolidated financial statements that are drawn up in accordance
                    with the Accounting Directive. The Application Guidance aims to assist entities
                    in adopting a consistent approach to this issue. In the absence of the guidance,
                    companies and their auditors might feel obliged to take an overly cautious
                    approach in response to uncertainty about whether the exemptions can be used.

                <p>It is generally accepted that the reference to equivalence in <act-si-ref
                        act-name="ca2006" section="401">s401</act-si-ref> does not mean compliance
                    with every detail of the Accounting Directive. When assessing whether
                    consolidated financial statements of a higher non-EEA parent are drawn up in a
                    manner equivalent to consolidated financial statements drawn up in accordance
                    with the Accounting Directive, it is necessary to consider whether they meet the
                    basic requirements of the Accounting Directive; in particular the requirement to
                    give a true and fair view, without implying strict conformity with each and
                    every provision. A qualitative approach is more in keeping with the deregulatory
                    nature of the exemption than a requirement to consider the detailed requirements

                        regarded as equivalent for the purposes of the disclosure exemptions. For
                        example, this means that disclosures under US GAAP or Japanese GAAP will be
                        regarded as meeting the test. However, as indicated in the next paragraph,
                        the exemptions are conditional on some relevant disclosures being made in
                        the consolidated financial statements so it will always be necessary to
                        examine them to ensure this is the case even when the underlying GAAP is

                    relation to intragroup balances, those intragroup balances have been eliminated
                    on consolidation. If, however, no disclosure is made in the consolidated
                    financial statements on the grounds of materiality, the relevant disclosures
                    should be made at the subsidiary level if material in those financial

                    <p>This is a slightly odd requirement. It is clear that the consolidated

                        provide no information about the amounts involved for any particular
                        subsidiary using the exemption. The purpose of the <q>equivalent</q>
                        disclosures is, therefore, not to provide a user of the financial statements
                        of a subsidiary with information about that subsidiary. It therefore appears
                        curious that a subsidiary will lose the benefit of the exemption merely
                        because the amounts are not material at group level.</p>

                        appropriate disclosures are made in each area for which exemption is claimed
                        and is dependent on equivalent disclosures. This should not generally be an
                        issue because, for example, the consolidated financial statements might be
                        expected always to include some disclosures about financial instruments.</p>

                        amendment confirms that this is not the case. For example, in the case of
                        financial instruments, the test will be met if the consolidated financial
                        statements make disclosures about financial instruments in accordance with

            <heading>The true and fair view</heading>
            <p>The Act includes a requirement that the directors of a company must not approve the
                accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the
                assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company. In the
                case of group accounts this requirement applies to the undertakings included in the
                consolidation as a whole, so far as concerns the members of the company.

                    s393(1)</act-si-ref>] This overarching requirement applies irrespective of
                whether the accounts are prepared under IFRSs or UK GAAP.</p>
            <p><act-si-ref act-name="ca2006" section="393">Section 393</act-si-ref> was not in the
                original Companies Bill but was added as the Bill was making its way through
                Parliament. The ministerial statement on its introduction was to the effect that the
                clear primacy of the true and fair concept had become blurred as a result of a
                combination of UK and EU law provisions. The opportunity was being taken to express
                the principle more clearly in the legislation.</p>
            <p>In May 2008, the FRC published an Opinion by Martin Moore QC on the continued
                relevance of the true and fair requirement for the preparation and audit of
                financial statements following the introduction of IFRSs and the enactment of the
                2006 Act. The opinion, which is available on the FRC website (<web-ref
                    http="www.frc.org.uk"><i>www.frc.org.uk</i></web-ref>), confirms the continuing
                relevance of earlier legal opinions on the interpretation of the true and fair
                requirement. One of the significant conclusions in the May 2008 Opinion is that <q
                    quote-marks="double">the requirement set out in applicable international
                    accounting standards to present fairly is not a different requirement to that of
                    showing a true and fair view but is a different articulation of the same
                    concept</q>.</p>
            <p>There should not be a conflict between the requirement to comply with IFRSs and the
                requirement to give a true and fair view except in extremely rare circumstances.
                However, the Opinion notes that the preparation of financial statements is not a
                mechanical process where compliance with accounting standards will automatically
                ensure that those statements show a true and fair view, or a fair presentation. For
                example, additional disclosures might be required to achieve a true and fair
                view.</p>
            <p>In June 2014, the FRC published a statement <q>True and fair</q> reconfirming that
                the presentation of a true and fair view remains a fundamental requirement of
                financial reporting. The statement reflects developments in UK GAAP, finalisation of
                EU audit legislation, legal advice obtained and published by the FRC in October
                2013, and feedback from stakeholders seeking clarity as to the primary requirement
                to present a true and fair view. However, it does not change the conclusions reached
                in the 2008 opinion referred to above.</p>
            <p>In addition to the overriding requirement in <act-si-ref act-name="ca2006"

            <p>In June 2002, the <eu-ref eu-commission="1606/2002">European Commission (the
                        <q>Commission</q>) adopted a Regulation (the <q>IAS Regulation</q>) [EC
                    Regulation No.1606/2002]</eu-ref> requiring certain companies governed by the
                law of a member state, for each financial year starting on or after 1 January 2005,
                to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with
                    <q>international accounting standards</q>. The companies concerned are those
                with their securities admitted to a <q>regulated market</q> in any member state at
                the end of the reporting period. The IAS Regulation explains that <q>international
                    accounting standards</q> means International Accounting Standards, International
                Financial Reporting Standards and related Interpretations issued or adopted by the
                IASB and endorsed by the EU. Accordingly, the European Commission applies an
                    <q>endorsement mechanism</q> to decide whether to endorse each Standard and
                Interpretation by reference to a number of qualitative criteria (understandability,
                relevance, reliability, comparability, the <q>European public good</q> and the need
                to give a <q>true and fair view</q>). The endorsement mechanism is described in
                    <xref commentary="dgaap" para="C1.1"><b>chapter C1</b></xref>.</p>
            <p>As explained above, the IAS Regulation requires companies governed by the law of a
                member state to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with
                (endorsed) international accounting standards if, at the end of the reporting
                period, their securities (equity or debt) are admitted to a <q>regulated market</q>
                of any member state. Various aspects of this requirement are discussed below.</p>
        </cch-paragraph>
        <cch-paragraph num="2.2">
            <heading>Meaning of <q>company</q></heading>
            <p>The Regulation applies to <q>companies</q>. Guidance issued by the European
                Commission in November 2003 (see <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A1.2.9"
                    ><b>2.9</b></xref> below) explains that companies are defined in the Treaty of
                Rome which states that:</p>
            <quote quote-marks="double">
                <p><q quote-marks="single">Companies or firms</q> means companies or firms
                    constituted under civil or commercial law, including co-operative societies, and
                    other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which are
                    non-profit-making.</p>
            </quote>
            <p>The guidance goes on to note that this definition is reflected in the scope of each
                of the Accounting Directives (which have been enacted into UK law, currently in the
                    <act-si-ref act-name="ca2006">Companies Act 2006</act-si-ref>). Accordingly, in
                principle, all companies incorporated under the Companies Act are within the scope
                of the Regulation unless they are <q>non profit making</q>. However, most are not
                required to adopt IFRSs because they do not have securities admitted to a regulated
                market.</p>
            <p>The Regulation applies to some entities that are not companies incorporated under the
                Companies Act but are <q>companies</q> under the Treaty of Rome. A DTI (now BEIS)
                Consultation Document issued in March 2004 indicated that these include building
                societies, friendly societies and industrial and provident societies.</p>
            <p>LLPs are not <q>companies</q> for this purpose. They are not required by EU law to
                comply with the Accounting Directive but the UK Government has chosen to apply
                similar financial reporting requirements to them. It seems unlikely that an LLP
                would have securities admitted to a regulated market.</p>

                <p>Guidance issued by the European Commission in November 2003 (see <xref
                        commentary="dgaap" para="A1.2.9"><b>2.9</b></xref> below) clarifies that the
                    determination of whether or not a company is required to prepare consolidated
                    financial statements will continue to be made by reference to national law
                    transposed from the Seventh Directive (now incorporated into the Accounting
                    Directive). In the UK context this means the 2006 Act.</p>
                <text-note notetype="deloitte-interpretation">
                    <p>It is not clear what role accounting standards should play in this
                        evaluation. Until recently, it had been assumed that reference would be made
                        to <standard-ref type="frs" num="2">FRS 2</standard-ref> for guidance on the
                        interpretation of the law. For example, to the extent that <standard-ref
                            type="frs" num="2">FRS 2</standard-ref> narrows certain exemptions
                        available in company law and compliance with <standard-ref type="frs"
                            num="2">FRS 2</standard-ref> is necessary to give a true and fair view,
                        a wider interpretation would not be appropriate. However, the publication of
                            <standard-ref type="frs" num="10214">FRS 102</standard-ref> has raised a
                        valid question about whether regard should be had to <standard-ref
                            type="frs" num="2">FRS 2</standard-ref>, <standard-ref type="frs"
                            num="10214">FRS 102</standard-ref> or both or neither. In practice, the
                        answers will almost always be consistent and therefore this should only be
                        an issue in very rare cases.</p>
                    <p>The most common application of this requirement is in fact when the parent
                        company has no subsidiaries at the reporting date and therefore is not
                        required to prepare consolidated financial statements under the Act. IFRSs
                        as issued by the IASB would require consolidated financial statements if the
                        parent had subsidiaries during the year but sold them all before the year
                        end (see below).</p>
                </text-note>
                <p>However, this distinction is only relevant to the determination of whether
                    consolidated financial statements are required and not to the scope of any
                    consolidation. For example, once it has been established that consolidated
                    financial statements are required, it is not possible to exclude a subsidiary
                    from consolidation based on an exemption in national law when this would not be
                    permitted under IFRSs. This is considered in more detail in the
                    Commission&#x2019;s guidance.</p>
                <p>Under the Act, consolidated financial statements will be required if:</p>
                <list type="bullet">
                    <item>
                        <p>the company was a parent company (i.e. it had subsidiary undertakings) at
                            its period end; unless</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>it is exempt from preparing consolidated financial statements.</p>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>If a company disposes of all its subsidiary undertakings during the year, it will
                    not be required to prepare group financial statements as a matter of law. This
                    contrasts with the position under IFRSs as issued by the IASB (see <xref
                        commentary="dgaap" para="C24.3.4"><b>3.4</b> in <b>chapter C24</b></xref>).
                    Such a company will fall outside of the scope of the IAS Regulation even though
                        <standard-ref type="ifrs" num="10">IFRS 10</standard-ref> would require the
                    preparation of consolidated financial statements in these circumstances. In this
                    case the company will be able to state that its separate financial statements
                    have been prepared in accordance with EU-adopted IFRSs but not that they are in
                    accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.</p>
                <p>The UK GAAP definition of subsidiary undertaking is considered at <xref
                        commentary="dgaap" para="A1.2.4" anchor="2.4.2"><b>2.4.2</b></xref> below
                    and the UK GAAP exemptions from preparing consolidated financial statements are
                    considered at <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A1.2.4" anchor="2.4.3"
                        ><b>2.4.3</b></xref> below. In almost all cases it will be immediately
                    apparent either that consolidated financial statements are required or that they
                    are not required, irrespective of whether this is considered under UK GAAP or
                    IFRSs. It is, however, important to understand the distinction explained above
                    which will be relevant in rare cases.</p>

                <heading>2.4.2 Definition of subsidiary undertaking</heading>
                <p>The definition of a subsidiary undertaking used under the Act is different from
                    that of a subsidiary under IFRSs (see <xref commentary="dgaap" para="C24.4"
                            ><b>section 4</b> in <b>chapter C24</b></xref>). Accordingly, it is
                    possible that an undertaking may be a subsidiary undertaking under the Act, even
                    though it would not be a subsidiary under IFRSs or vice versa. In practice it is
                    unlikely that different conclusions will be reached over whether control
                    exists.</p>
                <text-note notetype="deloitte-interpretation">
                    <p>Under old UK GAAP, the definition of a subsidiary undertaking in

                        is justified only when the effect of the restrictions is to prevent the
                        parent from controlling the subsidiary undertaking.</p>

                        consolidation where severe long-term restrictions substantially hinder the
                        exercise of the rights of the parent over the assets or management of the
                        subsidiary.</p>

                        <p>The rights referred to must be those that result in the undertaking being
                            a subsidiary undertaking (under <act-si-ref act-name="ca2006"

                            which, it would not be a subsidiary undertaking. Since control is most
                            commonly achieved through the exercise of votes in a general meeting,
                            restrictions justifying exclusion would normally involve the parent
                            being rendered unable to exercise those votes. Similarly, if the
                            definition of subsidiary undertaking is met by another of the

                            clauses, e.g. control of votes in the management body, or actual
                            exercise of dominant influence, it would need to be demonstrated that
                            this essential aspect of control had been removed or restricted to the
                            point where control no longer exists. <standard-ref type="frs"

                            voluntary arrangement does not necessarily lead to loss of control.

                        <p>It should be noted that, though a liquidation implies severe long-term
                            restrictions, a receivership or administration order does not give rise

                            after the year end, the issue arises as to whether that subsidiary can
                            be excluded from consolidation. As stated at <xref commentary="dgaap"
                                para="A1.2.4" anchor="2.4.1"><b>2.4.1</b></xref> above, the
                            assessment of whether group financial statements are required depends on
                            the situation at the end of the reporting period. As the administrator,
                            administrative receiver or liquidator is appointed after the reporting
                            period, there are no severe long-term restrictions at the end of the
                            reporting period and therefore the subsidiary should be included in the
                            group financial statements.</p>
                        <p>Restrictions on cash flows from a subsidiary undertaking, perhaps because
                            it is located in a foreign jurisdiction, do not normally amount to a
                            severe restriction of rights. The fact that a parent may not be able to
                            remit dividends from the subsidiary or use the funds for other parts of
                            the group outside the country of operation does not by itself indicate
                            that the parent no longer has control over the operating and financial
                            policies of that subsidiary. Indeed, subsidiaries are often set up in
                            the face of such restrictions and are, presumably, expected to be
                            beneficial to the parent.</p>

                            instance, an entity may have initially lent money on the security of a
                            property. The borrower subsequently defaults on the loan and enters into
                            a financial restructuring whereby the lender receives a majority of
                            shares in the borrower. The lender should exclude the subsidiary from
                            consolidation on the grounds that in effect it was acquired as a result
                            of the enforcement of a security, unless, of course, the interest has,
                            or is to, become part of the investor&#x2019;s continuing

                <p>It was a political decision not to extend the scope of the IAS Regulation to
                    individual accounts because they are used for a variety of legal purposes such
                    as the basis for taxation and for ascertaining distributable profits. At the

            <p>In a Consultation Paper issued in October 2003 (CP 203) the FSA (now FCA) invited
                comments on whether the Listing Rules should require issuers that do not have
                subsidiaries to prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRSs. It
                noted that the great majority of quoted <q>solo companies</q> are investment trusts,
                which prepare their financial statements in accordance with the relevant Statement
                of Recommended Practice (SORP). The FSA (now FCA) pointed out that if such companies
                were required to use IFRSs, they would no longer be able to apply the SORP. There is
                no equivalent pronouncement in the IFRS literature.</p>
            <p>Following the outcome of this consultation, the Listing Rules were revised but did
                not require compliance with IFRSs. Those rules have subsequently been superseded by
                DTR 4.1.6R which provides that an issuer that is not required to prepare
                consolidated financial statements must prepare financial statements in accordance
                with the national law of the EEA State in which the issuer is incorporated.
                Companies incorporated in the UK therefore have a choice between UK GAAP and IFRSs
                which are both permitted by law. Some solo companies have decided to adopt IFRSs in
                any event to be consistent with competitors or because they are finance subsidiaries
                within larger groups using IFRSs. Most investment trusts continue to report under UK
                GAAP.</p>

            <p>AIM operates as an exchange-regulated market. This means that AIM companies fall
                outside the scope of the IAS Regulation. However, the AIM Rules require an AIM
                company incorporated in an EEA country to prepare its consolidated financial
                statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted in the EU.</p>
            <p>The AIM Rules extend the definition of EEA to include the Channel Islands and Isle of
                Man. Hence AIM companies incorporated in these countries have to prepare their
                consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted in the EU.
                However, if, at the end of the relevant financial year, the company is not a parent
                company, it may prepare its financial statements either in accordance with IFRSs or
                in accordance with the accounting and company legislation and regulations that are
                applicable to the company due to its country of incorporation (i.e. UK GAAP in the
                case of a UK company).</p>
            <p>The intention is to mirror the rules applicable to listed companies (i.e. solo
                companies are not required to apply IFRSs) but the wording used is slightly

                    that all of its subsidiaries are immaterial or subject to severe long-term
                    restrictions. However, in practice companies may ask via their Nomad for a
                    derogation from this requirement and continue to prepare UK GAAP financial

            <heading>ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange (ISDX)</heading>
            <p>Following its purchase of PLUS Stock Exchanges Limited in June 2012, ICAP launched
                ICAP Securities and Derivative Exchange (ISDX) in October 2012. It operates three
                markets aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
            <p>ISDX Main Board is an EU regulated market for officially listed securities. Companies
                on this market are subject to the same reporting requirements as those listed on the
                main market of the London Stock Exchange and must, therefore, prepare any
                consolidated financial statements under IFRSs and comply with the Listing Rules of
                the FCA.</p>
            <p>ISDX Growth Market is a market for unlisted securities with a regulatory framework
                dedicated to the needs of smaller companies. It is not an EU regulated market and so
                companies traded on it are not required to prepare their consolidated financial
                statements under IFRSs. They must instead comply with the <i>ISDX Growth Market
                    &#x2013; Rules for Issuers</i>. These rules permit financial statements to be
                prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, US GAAP, IFRSs or other appropriate standards
                agreed with ISDX. For a UK incorporated company, the choice will in practice be
                between UK GAAP and IFRSs.</p>
            <p>ICAP Secondary Market is a trading venue for both listed and unlisted securities. It
                is a secondary market and companies traded on it comply with the rules applicable to
                their primary market.</p>

        <cch-paragraph num="2.8">
            <heading>Unlisted groups with listed subsidiaries</heading>
            <p>A privately owned group may have raised finance by means of a subsidiary company
                issuing listed debt. In these circumstances, the consolidated financial statements
                of the group are not required to be prepared in accordance with IFRSs. This is
                because the IAS Regulation applies to <i>companies</i> that have <i>their</i>
                securities admitted to trading on a regulated market.</p>

            <heading>Introduction</heading>
            <p>The IAS Regulation gives Member States an option to permit or require that:</p>
            <list type="bullet">
                <item>
                    <p>the individual (i.e. separate) company financial statements of listed

                </item>
            </list>
            <p>should also be prepared under IFRSs.</p>
            <p>This has been implemented in the UK to allow companies, other than charities, to
                prepare their individual and/or group financial statements in accordance with either
                UK GAAP or IFRSs, subject to the constraints discussed below. Companies that are
                charities must continue to prepare their individual and group financial statements
                in accordance with UK GAAP.</p>
            <p>In very rare circumstances it may be possible for a UK incorporated company to adopt
                either US GAAP or Japanese GAAP for its group accounts but not its individual
                accounts. This is possible as a result of <i><act-si-ref si-number="2015/1675">The
                        Accounting Standards (Prescribed Bodies) (United States of America and

                applies only where the company has securities registered with the SEC (in the case
                of US GAAP) or is traded on certain Japanese Stock Exchanges (in the case of
                Japanese GAAP). The Regulations came into effect on 1 October 2015 and replaced
                previous Regulations issued in 2012. The concession is available for a parent
                company&#x2019;s first four financial years following incorporation. Any financial
                years during which it was dormant count towards this limit. The concession is not
                available to any company which is required under the IAS Regulation to prepare IFRS
                consolidated accounts (see <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A1.2.1"><b>2.1</b></xref>
                above). Accounts prepared under these requirements are <q>Companies Act group

                Act and the Accounting Regulations and give a true and fair view. Such accounts are
                not considered further in this manual.</p>

                    introduced greater flexibility in the formats for the balance sheet and profit

            </text-note>
            <p>When companies prepare both individual and group financial statements, the choice
                between IFRSs and UK GAAP operates separately for each. A company that is required
                by <act-si-ref si-number="1992/807" article="4">Article 4 of the IAS
                    Regulation</act-si-ref> to use IFRSs for its consolidated financial statements
                still has a free choice of using IFRSs or UK GAAP for its individual (i.e. separate)
                financial statements. Similarly, a company outside of the scope of the IAS
                Regulation that has chosen to use IFRSs for its consolidated financial statements
                does not have to use IFRSs for its individual (i.e. separate) financial statements.
                Although less likely in practice, it would also be possible by law for a parent
                company to prepare IAS individual financial statements while preparing UK GAAP
                consolidated financial statements.</p>
            <p>The Act specifies that, if consolidated financial statements are required, the
                consolidated and individual (i.e. separate) financial statements should be published
                together. This continues to apply if the consolidated and individual financial
                statements are prepared using different frameworks. The Act does not specify whether
                the financial statements should be presented as separate sections of the report or
                combined together into a single set of primary statements and notes. In practice,
                the statements will be clearer if the separate section approach is taken when two
                frameworks are combined in a single document. The availability of the exemption in
                    <act-si-ref act-name="ca2006" section="408">s408</act-si-ref> from presenting

                following a relevant change of circumstance, or for other reasons not more than once
                every five years.</p>
            <text-note notetype="deloitte-interpretation">
                <p>The restriction on when it is possible to move from IAS accounts to Companies Act
                    accounts is because, when the requirements were originally introduced, it was
                    assumed that UK GAAP was being phased out and replaced with IFRSs. This never
                    happened. The restriction was subsequently partly relaxed by permitting a change
                    for <q>other reasons</q> not more than once every five years to facilitate
                    companies previously reporting under IFRSs adopting <standard-ref type="frs"
                        num="101">FRS 101</standard-ref> or <standard-ref type="frs" num="102">FRS
                        102</standard-ref>.</p>
                <p>When a company prepares IAS individual accounts and in a subsequent year there is
                    a relevant change in circumstance, there does not appear to be anything in the
                    law to say that the company can change back to UK GAAP only in the year when the
                    relevant change of circumstance occurs. Therefore, once there has been a
                    relevant change of circumstance (after the first IAS accounts are prepared), a
                    change back to UK GAAP can be made in any subsequent year (not just the year in
                    which the change occurs). However, this issue is less significant with the
                    additional flexibility to change for other reasons not more than once every five
                    years.</p>

            <p>As explained at <xref commentary="dgaap" para="C3.4.3"><b>4.3</b> in <b>chapter
                        C3</b></xref>, a company may be a first-time adopter of IFRSs, for the

                more than one occasion. It can then choose either to apply <standard-ref type="ifrs"

                IAS group accounts, but any move in the opposite direction is only possible
                following a relevant change of circumstance, or for other reasons not more than once
                every five years.</p>
            <text-note notetype="deloitte-interpretation">
                <p>The restriction on when it is possible to move from IAS accounts to Companies Act
                    accounts is because, when the requirements were originally introduced, it was
                    assumed that UK GAAP was being phased out and replaced with IFRSs. This never
                    happened. The restriction was subsequently partly relaxed by permitting a change
                    for <q>other reasons</q> not more than once every five years to facilitate
                    companies previously reporting under IFRSs adopting <standard-ref type="frs"
                        num="101">FRS 101</standard-ref> or <standard-ref type="frs" num="102">FRS
                        102</standard-ref>.</p>
                <p>When a company prepares IAS group accounts and in a subsequent year there is a
                    relevant change of circumstance, there does not appear to be anything in the law
                    to say that the company can change back to UK GAAP only in the year when the
                    relevant change of circumstance occurs. Therefore, once there has been a
                    relevant change of circumstance (after the first IAS group accounts are
                    prepared), a change back to UK GAAP can be made in any subsequent year (not just
                    the year in which the change occurs). However, this issue is less significant
                    with the additional flexibility to change for other reasons not more than once
                    every five years.</p>
                <p>It is not entirely clear whether <act-si-ref act-name="ca2006" section="403"
                        >s403</act-si-ref> can be applied retrospectively when a relevant change of
                    circumstance arises after the balance sheet date, although the drafting does not
                    seem to prohibit this. However, if the relevant change of circumstance is that
                    the company ceases to have securities admitted to trading on a regulated market,
                    the company could not revert to UK GAAP for its consolidated accounts for the
                    year in question. This is because the IAS Regulation itself specifies that
                    companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market <i>at the
                        year end</i> must prepare their consolidated accounts in accordance with
                    IFRSs as adopted by the EU.</p>

                        this does not prevent its parent or subsidiary undertakings from preparing

            <p>The second exception was provided so as not to discourage parent companies from using

                because parent companies are required to present their individual and group
                financial statements within the same annual report. There are obvious advantages of
                using a consistent financial reporting framework for both. However, there may also
                be some significant disadvantages including the potential effect on distributable

            <p>The exception does not apply to the reverse situation (i.e. when the subsidiaries
                prepare IAS individual accounts and the parent wants to prepare Companies Act

                    <p>a group may contain subsidiary undertakings that are themselves publicly
                        traded, so that market pressures or regulatory requirements to use IFRSs
                        might come into play, without necessarily justifying a switch to IFRSs for
                        the non-publicly traded subsidiaries;</p>

                <item>
                    <p>a subsidiary undertaking (or a parent) may be planning to list and so might
                        wish to convert to IFRSs in advance, but the rest of group may not intend to
                        list; and</p>

            <p>The examples given in the guidance notes do not appear to be intended to be
                exhaustive. The guidance notes conclude that <q quote-marks="double">the key point
                    is that the directors of the parent company must be able to justify any

                        102</standard-ref> are Companies Act accounts. Therefore, there is no legal

                <p>More generally, it is difficult to envisage the circumstances in which the
                    judgement of the directors that there are good reasons will be challenged or who
                    would make such a challenge. Indeed, the wording of the requirement is such that
                    it is only necessary to show that it is the genuinely held opinion of the
                    directors that there are good reasons even if others might have formed a

                <p>It is worth bearing in mind that the obligation to ensure consistency of
                    accounting frameworks, subject to the permitted exceptions, is placed on the
                    directors of the parent company. The directors of a subsidiary would not be in
                    breach of the law if they chose to prepare the financial statements of that

                the requirement to publish its individual profit and loss account and the related
                notes. As a matter of law, companies reporting under IFRSs in their individual (i.e.
                separate) financial statements can use this exemption. There was initially some
                uncertainty about whether companies could use this exemption in practice, for
                example, because they would be unable to make an unqualified statement of compliance
                with IFRSs. However, the DTI (now BEIS) published guidance notes which indicate
                that, in its view, a company&#x2019;s ability to apply <standard-ref type="ifrs"
                    num="1">IFRS 1</standard-ref> would not be affected. This is on the basis that

            <p>Most UK companies use the exemption in practice. The exemption is discussed further
                in the context of UK GAAP at <xref commentary="dgaap" para="B9.7.4"><b>7.4</b> in

                <p>For parent companies which prepare their separate financial statements under
                    IFRSs, the question arises as to how the statutory exemption interacts with the
                    requirement in <standard-ref type="ias" num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref> to prepare
                    a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (commonly referred
                    to as the statement of comprehensive income, or SOCI). Is the whole of the SOCI
                    exempt from publication or does the exemption cover only that part which is
                    equivalent to the <q>profit and loss account</q>? Is the answer affected by
                    whether the company presents a single SOCI or uses the option in <standard-ref
                        type="ias" num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref> to present a separate statement of
                    profit or loss? It is considered that the exemption extends to the whole of the
                    SOCI irrespective of whether it is presented as a single statement or two
                    statements for the following reasons.</p>
                <p>Under <standard-ref type="ias" num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref> as revised in 2007,
                    it is reasonable to equate the SOCI in <standard-ref type="ias" num="1">IAS
                        1</standard-ref> with the profit and loss account in the Act because they
                    are the names given to the primary performance statement in the respective
                    regimes. When a separate statement of profit or loss is presented as permitted
                    by <standard-ref type="ias" num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref>, the SOCI is clearly a
                    performance statement and not part of the Statement of Changes in Equity (as it
                    was under previous requirements).</p>
                <p>The same analysis would apply to a company applying <standard-ref type="frs"

                comply with the accounting requirements of the Act, including IFRSs as adopted by
                the EU and the requirement to give a true and fair view.</p>
            <p>The Act includes procedures for the revision of defective accounts (see <xref
                    commentary="dgaap" para="A8.1"><b>chapter A8</b></xref>). These procedures
                include allowing a person, authorised by the Secretary of State, the power to apply
                to the court for an order requiring the directors of a company to prepare revised
                financial statements. Following the changes to the FRC structure in July 2012, the
                Secretary of State has authorised the Conduct Committee of the FRC (the Conduct
                Committee) for this purpose. This authorisation was previously held by the Financial
                Reporting Review Panel (FRRP) which still exists but has a different status under
                the revised FRC structure. The Conduct Committee maintains the FRRP comprising
                individuals who have the appropriate qualifications and experience to sit on a
                    <q>Review Group</q> set up by the Conduct Committee to consider a particular
                case.</p>
            <p>A company that prepares <q>IAS group accounts</q> or <q>IAS individual accounts</q>
                is under a direct legal obligation to prepare those accounts in accordance with
                IFRSs as adopted by the EU. This is different from the position under UK GAAP where
                the obligation to comply with accounting standards is an indirect one which operates
                through the requirement to give a true and fair view.</p>

            <p>When the Secretary of State believes that a company&#x2019;s financial statements,
                directors&#x2019; report or strategic report may not comply with the requirements of
                the Act, he or she may give notice to the directors indicating the matters in
                question. If, after a specified period (not less than one month), the directors have
                not given the Secretary of State a satisfactory explanation or have not revised the
                financial statements, directors&#x2019; report or strategic report so as to comply
                with the Act, the Secretary of State may apply to the court to order the directors
                to do so. [<act-si-ref act-name="ca2006" section="455">CA 2006
                s455</act-si-ref>]</p>
            <p>If the court orders the preparation of revised financial statements, it may give
                directions with respect to the auditing of the revised annual financial statements,
                the revision of any directors&#x2019; report, directors&#x2019; remuneration report
                or strategic report, and the steps required by the directors to bring the making of
                the court order to the notice of persons likely to rely on the previous financial
                statements. If the court orders the company to prepare a revised directors&#x2019;
                report or strategic report it may give directions as to the review of the report by
                the auditors and steps required by the directors to bring making of the court order
                to the notice of persons likely to rely on the previous report. If the court finds
                that the accounts or report did not comply with the Act, it may order all costs or
                any part of the costs in connection with the application and the revision of the
                financial statements to be borne by those directors who had approved the defective
                financial statements. [<act-si-ref act-name="ca2006" section="456">CA 2006

            <heading>Enforcement by the Conduct Committee of the FRC</heading>
            <p>The Conduct Committee&#x2019;s authority extends to all companies that prepare
                financial statements under the Act irrespective of whether they are prepared under
                IFRSs or UK GAAP. In practice, the Conduct Committee normally exercises this
                authority only in connection with the financial statements of public companies and
                large private companies. The Conduct Committee may, however, exercise its authority
                in connection with the financial statements of other companies when it considers
                appropriate. The following come within the Conduct Committee&#x2019;s remit:</p>
            <list type="bullet">
                <item>
                    <p>public limited companies;</p>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <p>companies within a group headed by a PLC;</p>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <p>any private company not qualifying as small or medium-sized; and</p>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <p>any private company within a group which does not qualify as small or
                        medium-sized.</p>
                </item>
            </list>
            <p>The financial statements of those companies outside of the Conduct Committee&#x2019;s
                remit are the responsibility of BEIS.</p>
            <p>The Conduct Committee can ask directors to explain apparent departures from law and
                accounting requirements. If the Conduct Committee is not satisfied by the
                directors&#x2019; explanations, it aims to persuade them to adopt a more appropriate
                treatment. The directors may then voluntarily withdraw the financial statements,
                directors&#x2019; report or strategic report and replace them with revised financial
                statements or a revised report, which correct the error. Depending on the
                circumstances, the Conduct Committee may accept other forms of remedial action, for
                example restatement of the comparative figures in the next annual financial
                statements. Failing voluntary correction, the Conduct Committee can exercise its
                powers to secure the necessary revision of the original financial statements or
                report through a court order. The Conduct Committee maintains a legal costs fund of
                &#x00A3;2 million for this purpose. To date the Conduct Committee (and its
                predecessor, the FRRP) has been successful in resolving all cases brought to its
                attention without having to apply for a court order.</p>
            <p>The Conduct Committee does not offer advice on the application of accounting
                standards or the requirements of the Act. There is no provision for
                    <q>pre-clearance</q> of accounting treatments with the Conduct Committee as
                happens in some other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>When it was established, the FRRP did not actively monitor the financial statements
                of those companies within its remit. It responded to complaints from members of the
                public, referrals from the FSA (now FCA) of companies whose auditors had qualified
                their reports and unfavourable press comments on companies&#x2019; financial
                statements. However, it assumed a pro-active role in response to the 2003 report of
                the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting. This group was set up by the
                Government to consider how the UK should respond to some well publicised corporate
                failures around that time.</p>
            <p>The Conduct Committee now considers any matter drawn to its attention from a review
                of reports selected by the Conduct Committee, or by complaints or press comments,
                including matters drawn to its attention by the FCA and by HMRC. It initially
                considers whether there is, prima facie, a case to answer. When there is such a
                case, the Chairman appoints a Review Group to conduct the enquiry. A group is
                normally made up of five members including the Chairman and one of the Deputy
                Chairmen. Other members are chosen to provide a balance of experience relevant to
                the enquiry and to avoid any conflicts of interests. The other members of the FRRP
                are not involved and the group&#x2019;s exchanges with the company are
                confidential.</p>
            <p>The Review Group puts its concerns to the directors and may discuss them in
                correspondence and at meetings. The Conduct Committee encourages directors to
                consult their auditors, to involve their audit committee and to take any other
                advice they feel necessary. The process is informal but is intended to combine
                efficiency with fairness. As defective financial statements could mislead the
                public, the procedures are intended to allow for speedy rectification. The Review
                Group aims to reach agreement with the directors of the company by persuasion. If
                the Review Group is satisfied by the company&#x2019;s explanations, the case is
                closed and the fact that an enquiry was made remains confidential. When the
                directors agree to take some remedial action, the Conduct Committee may issue a
                Press Notice. It may also do so in other circumstances following changes to its
                operating procedures in 2012. The Conduct Committee does not comment on or discuss
                its conclusions.</p>
            <p>The Conduct Committee selects reports and accounts for review in a number of ways.
                First, entities may be selected from specific sectors of the economy &#x2013; for
                example those regarded as under particular stress. Second, reviews are prompted by
                specific topical accounting issues that may give rise to issues of increased
                subjectivity, judgement and risk of misstatement in corporate reporting. Last,
                complaints from the public, the press and the City may result in the selection of
                reports for review. In all cases, the selection is based on the Conduct
                Committee&#x2019;s assessment of the risk of non-compliance and the risk of
                significant consequences if there is non-compliance.</p>
            <p>When UK companies report under IFRSs, enforcement is still a matter of UK company
                law. The Conduct Committee continues to play the role described above. However, in
                the IAS Regulation, the European Commission requested (what is now) the European
                Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to develop a harmonised approach to the
                enforcement of financial information in the EU. Pursuant to this mandate, the
                sub-committee on enforcement developed standards and application guidance with which
                all qualifying national enforcers are expected to comply and which provides for the
                co-ordination of enforcement activities. The Conduct Committee may, from time to
                time, propose issues arising from individual cases for discussion at extended
                sessions of the sub-committee. The Conduct Committee only identifies the company
                concerned if it has concluded the case and issued a press notice or the case has
                otherwise become public. The Conduct Committee is obliged to report certain cases of
                substance for inclusion in the database established by ESMA to assist in the
                harmonisation of EU accounting requirements.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the Conduct Committee has developed a practice of using so-called
                    <q>Committee references</q> in the majority of situations in which remedial
                action has been taken following its intervention, rather than issuing press notices.
                These involve the Committee requesting that in the report and accounts in which the
                company makes the change, reference is made to the Committee&#x2019;s intervention.
                Such a reference allows the committee to ensure that investors and preparers are
                aware of the issue without necessarily drawing attention of the market at large to
                the situation, where it is not considered that this is necessary. Changes made to
                the Conduct Committee&#x2019;s operating procedures in October 2014 formalised the
                position of <q>Committee references</q> and made certain other amendments.</p>

                    <i>Exemption from audit by parent guarantee</i>. The technical release provides

                <p>The guidance is concerned with the requirements for obtaining the exemption and
                    its effect. It provides no advice or recommendations as to the use of the
                    exemption. Directors of parent undertakings should weigh the benefits of using
                    the exemption with the costs of giving that guarantee, in particular the risk
                    that the guarantee may be called upon. The guidance notes that directors may
                    wish to take their own legal advice based on the specific facts and
                    circumstances. Some subsidiaries will require audits for contractual or
                    regulatory reasons.</p>
                <p>Counsel confirmed to the ICAEW that the guidance is consistent with English law

                                <p>Sometimes a company may have been excluded from consolidation on
                                    the grounds that it is immaterial. At first sight, this suggests
                                    that it is not <q>included in consolidated accounts</q> for the
                                    purposes of qualifying for the exemption. However, this seems a
                                    harsh view in cases when its inclusion would make no material
                                    difference, or perhaps no difference at all, to those
                                    consolidated accounts. It may be reasonable, in such cases, to
                                    take the view that the subsidiary is actually included and that
                                    there is an immaterial unadjusted error arising from the failure
                                    to actually include it mechanically in the consolidation
                                    process. This would not be appropriate if the consolidated
                                    accounts state that the subsidiary has been excluded from
                                    consolidation. However, such disclosure will not usually be made
                                    when the effect is immaterial.</p>

                    is from an obligation (to have an audit) arising each financial year and so to
                    give consent in advance of a financial year, on a prospective basis, might give

                        the guarantee and prepares consolidated accounts, there is no requirement
                        for the arrangements to be disclosed in the individual or consolidated
                        accounts of the ultimate parent.</p>
                    <p>When a parent has filed consolidated accounts at Companies House that do not
                        include the statement required by s479A, either due to oversight or because
                        it was not known at the time when they were filed that the directors of the
                        subsidiary in question intended to take this exemption, it is unlikely to be
                        possible to issue revised accounts that do include the statement. As set out
                        in <xref commentary="dgaap" para="A8.1"><b>chapter A8</b></xref>, s454 of
                        the Act only permits revision of accounts when the original set did not
                        comply with the requirements of the Act or the IAS Regulation and, where the
                        accounts have already been filed, only permits revisions to correct those
                        respects in which the previous set did not comply with those requirements.
                        It seems unlikely that failure to include the statement required by s479A
                        would meet this test of non-compliance and therefore such a revision will
                        not usually be possible.</p>

                <p>The question of scope is one of law and not accounting. The ICAEW guidance states

                    obvious source of meaning for <q>liabilities</q> is insolvency law, which brings
                    in all types of pecuniary obligation, including contingent and prospective
                    liabilities (e.g. respectively, a litigation and future rentals on a lease), it
                    is uncertain whether and, if so, to what extent a court would restrict the set
                    of guaranteed liabilities as a result of the reference to <q>outstanding
                        liabilities</q>. Ultimately these uncertainties would be resolved if one or
                    more cases come before the courts. In the meantime, it would be prudent for
                    companies that are contemplating the giving of such a guarantee to establish the
                    population of the relevant subsidiaries&#x2019; liabilities, including
                    contingent and prospective liabilities since it is possible that they may be

                    liabilities have been settled. It could seek an indemnity from the purchaser of
                    the subsidiary but would remain liable to the creditors of the former

                <p>Charitable companies are required by the Charities Act to have an audit if they

                <p>For a company with a premium listing in the UK, LR 10.2.4 requires certain
                    indemnities and similar arrangements to be treated as class 1 transactions and
                    therefore to require shareholder approval. However, this does not apply to an
                    agreement or arrangement with a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of the
                    listed company. It therefore appears that provided the subsidiary in question is
                    wholly-owned, entering into a guarantee under <act-si-ref act-name="ca2006"
                        section="479A">s479A</act-si-ref> would not be a class 1 transaction. This

                    consultation by the UK Listing Authority (UKLA) in February 2013 which is

                        be regarded as being a class 1 transaction), warranted further consideration

        <cch-paragraph num="6.1">
            <heading>Introduction</heading>
            <p>Alternative performance measures (APMs), also known as non-GAAP measures, are any
                financial measures of an entity&#x0027;s historical or future performance, position
                or cash flows other than those defined or specified in the applicable financial
                reporting framework.</p>
            <p>Common examples of APMs range from those that are readily understood and consistently
                applied, such as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
                (EBITDA), to those where more subjectivity is introduced, such as <q
                    quote-marks="double">adjusted earnings</q>, where a variety of items may be
                stripped out. Even <q quote-marks="double">operating profit</q> is technically a
                non-GAAP measure for entities reporting under IFRSs or <standard-ref type="frs"
                    num="10214">FRS 102</standard-ref> because the term is not defined in those
                standards.</p>
            <p>APMs are often presented in a company&#x2019;s annual report but may also be used in
                other documents, such as:</p>

                disclosures issued under the requirements of article 17 of the Market Abuse

                <p>The introduction of the ESMA Guidelines does not change the underlying principles
                    regarding the presentation of APMs, as the FRC already challenges companies
                    where, in their view, the manner in which APMs are presented leads to the
                    strategic report not being sufficiently balanced. However, the ESMA Guidelines
                    contain a variety of detailed requirements that specify how entities should
                    comply with this underlying principle.</p>
                <p>The reason the ESMA Guidelines are described as <q>guidelines</q> is because they
                    are technically guidelines that apply to Competent Authorities under the EU
                    Transparency Directive, Market Abuse Regulation or Prospectus Directive.
                    Competent Authorities (in the UK, the FRC and FCA) must therefore consider

                <p>In relation to UK annual reports and interim reports, the FRC have published

                        Questions</q>, which confirms that they will consider the Guidelines when
                    reviewing company reports and accounts in assessing whether they are fair,
                    balanced and comprehensive. This will be done by the FRC&#x2019;s Corporate
                    Reporting Review team (CRR) extending its reviews of reports and accounts to
                    consider whether strategic reports are consistent with the ESMA Guidelines.
                    Where there are material inconsistencies, CRR will bring these to the attention
                    of the company and will take such inconsistencies into account when deciding
                    whether the strategic report is fair, balanced and comprehensive and, as a
                    consequence, whether enforcement action is required.</p>
                <p>Other than the information above on enforcement of the ESMA Guidelines in the UK,
                    the FRC&#x2019;s FAQs mainly provide a summarised version of the ESMA Guidelines
                    themselves, which is not repeated here. However, they also contain the following

                        <p>APMs are neither prohibited nor required by the ESMA Guidelines. The
                            choice of which APMs to provide, if any, is a matter of judgement of
                            those responsible for providing the information, such as the directors
                            in respect of the Annual Report. This judgement should be applied to
                            ensure the APMs provided are relevant and understandable for users
                            within the context of wider reporting responsibilities such as the
                            provision of an Annual Report that is fair, balanced and

                            whilst ensuring the linkages between related information are highlighted
                            and understood. Within the Annual Report linkages might exist between

                            and remuneration policies. Further guidance on clear communication,

                <heading>6.3.1 The definition of an APM</heading>
                <p>For the purpose of the ESMA Guidelines an APM is understood as a financial
                    measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or
                    cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the
                    applicable financial reporting framework. [ESMA Guidelines 17]</p>
                <p>APMs are usually derived from (or based on) the financial statements prepared in
                    accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, most of the time
                    by adding or subtracting amounts from the figures presented in financial
                    statements. Examples of APMs include: operating earnings, cash earnings,
                    earnings before onetime charges, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
                    and amortisation (EBITDA), net debt, autonomous growth or similar terms denoting
                    adjustments to line items of statements of comprehensive income, statements of
                    financial position or statements of cash flow. [ESMA Guidelines 18]</p>

                <p>Issuers or persons responsible for the prospectus should not mislabel items as

                        describing an APM as <q>headline earnings</q>, or labelling a measure as
                            <q>revenue growth</q> with a footnote indicating that this is <q>at

                        strategy or the determination of directors&#x2019; remuneration. The link
                        between KPIs and strategy can be illustrated in a variety of ways &#x2013;
                        one of the most common is to present a table with rows showing each element

                <p>Where financial statements of the corresponding period are not going to be

                        calculation of each APM and validate their consistency, for example seeing
                        how the adjusting items identified in relation to performance measures

                <p>APMs included in prospectuses should be used consistently for the financial

                <heading>6.4.2 Use of additional columns in the income statement</heading>
                <p>On 22 May 2014, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued an agenda decision
                    following a request to clarify some of the presentation requirements of
                        <standard-ref type="ias" num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref>. Concern had been
                    expressed that the absence of definitions in <standard-ref type="ias" num="1"
                        >IAS 1</standard-ref> and the lack of implementation guidance give
                    significant flexibility that may impair the comparability and understandability
                    of financial statements. The request for clarification provided several examples
                    including the presentation of additional statements or columns in the primary
                    statements.</p>
                <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that a complete set of financial
                    statements is comprised of items recognised and measured in accordance with
                    IFRS. The Interpretations Committee also noted that <standard-ref type="ias"
                        num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref> addresses the overall requirements for the
                    presentation of financial statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum
                    requirements for their content. It also noted that while <standard-ref
                        type="ias" num="1">IAS 1</standard-ref> does permit flexibility in
                    presentation, it also includes various principles for the presentation and
                    content of financial statements as well as more detailed requirements. These
                    principles and more detailed requirements are intended to limit the flexibility
                    such that financial statements present information that is relevant, reliable,
                    comparable and understandable.</p>
                <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that securities regulators, as well as
                    some members of the Interpretations Committee, were concerned about the
                    presentation of information in the financial statements that is not determined
                    in accordance with IFRS. They were particularly concerned when such information
                    is presented on the face of the primary statements. The Interpretations
                    Committee noted that it would be beneficial if the IASB&#x2019;s Disclosure
                    Initiative considered what guidance should be given for the presentation of
                    information beyond what is required in accordance with IFRS.</p>
                <p>Consequently, the Interpretations Committee determined that it should not propose
                    an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard and consequently decided not to
                    add this issue to its agenda. </p>
                <text-note notetype="deloitte-interpretation">
                    <p>A common method of presentation for non-GAAP measures in the UK is the use of
                        additional columns on the face of the income statement. The Interpretation
                        Committee agenda decision does not prohibit this practice but indicates that
                        its acceptability should be considered as part IASB&#x2019;s Disclosure
                        Initiative. However, it is important to ensure that any such columns are
                        properly described and explained and are not misleading.</p>

                <p>In June 2016, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
                    issued a Statement on Non-GAAP Financial Measures, intended for both an issuer
                    that prepares its financial statements in accordance with International
                    Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and an issuer that prepares financial
                    statements using a financial reporting framework other than IFRS.</p>
                <p>In this document, IOSCO has identified 12 elements as a frame of reference for
                    the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures which, if present, would
                    contribute to the reliability and comparability over time of non-GAAP financial

                            therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other

                            Presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, including information
                            provided by reference, should not in any way confuse or obscure the

                            the financial statements, the reconciliation should show how this figure

                        <p>In presenting non-GAAP financial measures, issuers sometimes seek to

                            costs or impairment losses being described as nonrecurring. Such items
                            should not be described as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual without
